# gui_xgboost_shap
This project implements an XGBoost Auto Tuner using Python and the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The application allows users to load a dataset, perform data preprocessing tasks, and optimize hyperparameters for an XGBoost model. The XGBoost model is trained, evaluated, and its results are displayed using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots.
